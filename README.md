# AWS-feedback-collector
A serverless AWS application that captures user feedback through an API, processes it with AWS Lambda (Python), stores it securely in DynamoDB, and sends real-time email alerts using Amazon SES. Built with scalability, clean backend logic, and cloud-native architecture in mind.
